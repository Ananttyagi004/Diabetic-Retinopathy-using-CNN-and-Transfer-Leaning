The objective of the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and transfer learning model for diabetic retinopathy is to accurately and efficiently detect and classify retinal images from diabetic patients. The CNN architecture is designed to automatically learn features from the retinal images, including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and other retinal abnormalities, to provide an accurate diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy severity.                                                                                                                                   Transfer learning is employed to leverage pre-trained models on large datasets to enhance the performance of the CNN model by fine-tuning it on a smaller diabetic retinopathy dataset. The ultimate goal of this model is to aid in early detection and management of diabetic retinopathy, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and vision preservation.                                                                           
The model is feeded with the MRI Scan of an eye and the model detects wether diabetic retinopathy or not.                                           
The present accuracy of the model is 98.438%
